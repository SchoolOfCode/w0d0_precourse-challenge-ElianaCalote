# Tribute page

**Why I chose the subject:** On the climate of the COP26 conference I decided to bring up this article about the Save the Arctic campaign and one of my favourite pianists. In this way people get an awareness of the Save the Arctic campaign and additionally they will also get to know Ludovico Eiunadi work and how he used his music to raise awareness for the climate crises we are facing.

**What I learned:**

**Reflection:**
Making this tribute page was great fun!

Whilst doing it, I feel that I have learnt a few important set of things:

1. Taking breaks is important.

2. To have a structured approach:
Define the problem
Plan the solution.
Built the solution.
Check the solution.
Modify the solution.

3. Close the tabs that are not in use anymore.
  
In the future I would like to learn to write cleaner code and explore CSS properties further.
